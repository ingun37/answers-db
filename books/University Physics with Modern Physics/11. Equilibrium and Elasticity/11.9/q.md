Two people carry a heavy electric motor by placing it on a light
board 2.00 m long. One person lifts at one end with a force of 400 N,
and the other lifts the opposite end with a force of 600 N. (a) What is the
weight of the motor, and where along the board is its center of gravity
located? (b) Suppose the board is not light but weighs 200 N, with its
center of gravity at its center, and the two people exert the same forces
as before. What is the weight of the motor in this case, and where is its
center of gravity located?
