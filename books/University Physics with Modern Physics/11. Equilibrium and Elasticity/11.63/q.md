BIO **Tendon-Stretching Exercises.** As part of an exercise program, a 75 kg person does toe
raises in which he raises his entire body weight on the ball of one
foot (**Fig. P11.63**). The Achilles
tendon pulls straight upward on
the heel bone of his foot. This tendon is 25 cm long and has a crosssectional area of 78 $`\text{mm}^2`$ and a Young’s modulus of 1470 MPa.
(a) Draw a free-body diagram of
the person’s foot (everything below
the ankle joint). Ignore the weight
of the foot. (b) What force does the Achilles tendon exert on the heel during this exercise? Express your answer in newtons and in multiples
of his weight. (c) By how many millimeters does the exercise stretch his
Achilles tendon?
