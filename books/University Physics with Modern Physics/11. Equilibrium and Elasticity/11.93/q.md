If he leans slightly farther back (increasing the angle between his body and the vertical) but remains stationary in this new position, which of the following statements is true? Assume that the rope remains horizontal. (a) The difference between $`T_1`$ and $`T_2`$ will increase, balancing the increased torque about his feet that his weight produces when he leans farther back; (b) the difference between $`T_1`$ and $`T_2`$ will decrease, balancing the increased torque about his feet that his weight produces when he leans farther back; (c) neither $`T_1`$ nor $`T_2`$ will change, because no other forces are changing; (d) both $`T_1`$ and $`T_2`$ will change, but the difference between them will remain the same.
