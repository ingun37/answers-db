A uniform steel rod has mass 0.300 kg and length 40.0 cm and
is horizontal. A uniform sphere with radius 8.00 cm and mass 0.900 kg is
welded to one end of the bar, and a uniform sphere with radius 6.00 cm
and mass 0.380 kg is welded to the other end of the bar. The centers of
the rod and of each sphere all lie along a horizontal line. How far is the
center of gravity of the combined object from the center of the rod?
