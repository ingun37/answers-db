A steel wire with radius rsteel has a fractional increase in length of $`(\Delta l / l_0)_{\text{steel}}`$ when the tension in the wire is increased from zero
to $`T_{\text{steel}}`$. An aluminum wire has radius $`r_{\text{al}}`$ that is twice the radius of the
steel wire: $`r_{\text{al}} = 2 r_{\text{steel}}`$. In terms of $`T_{\text{steel}}`$, what tension in the aluminum
wire produces the same fractional change in length as in the steel wire?
