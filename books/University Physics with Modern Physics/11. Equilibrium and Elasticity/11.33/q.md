BIO Compression of Human Bone. The bulk modulus for
bone is 15 GPa. (a) If a diver-in-training is put into a pressurized suit, by
how much would the pressure have to be raised (in atmospheres) above
atmospheric pressure to compress her bones by 0.10% of their original
volume? (b) Given that the pressure in the ocean increases by $`1.0 \times 10^4`$ Pa
for every meter of depth below the surface, how deep would this diver
have to go for her bones to compress by 0.10%? Does it seem that bone
compression is a problem she needs to be concerned with when diving?
