A 0.120 kg, 50.0-cm-long uniform bar has a small 0.055 kg
mass glued to its left end and a small 0.110 kg mass glued to the other
end. The two small masses can each be treated as point masses. You want
to balance this system horizontally on a fulcrum placed just under its
Â­ center of gravity. How far from the left end should the fulcrum be placed?
