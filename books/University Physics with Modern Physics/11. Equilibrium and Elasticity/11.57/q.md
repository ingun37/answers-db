The left-hand end of a uniform rod of length L and
mass m is attached to a vertical wall by a frictionless hinge. The rod is
held at an angle $`\theta`$ above the horizontal by a horizontal wire that runs
between the wall and the right-hand end of the rod. (a) If the tension in
the wire is T, what is the magnitude of the angle $`\theta`$ that the rod makes
with the horizontal? (b) The wire breaks and the rod rotates about the
hinge. What is the angular speed of the rod as the rod passes through a
horizontal position?
