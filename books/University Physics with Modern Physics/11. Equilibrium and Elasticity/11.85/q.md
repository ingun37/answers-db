CP BIO **Stress on the Shin Bone.** The compressive strength of our bones is important in everyday life. Youngâ€™s modulus for bone is about $`1.4 \times 10^{10} \text{ Pa}`$. Bone can take only about a $`1.0\%`$ change in its length before fracturing. (a) What is the maximum force that can be applied to a bone whose minimum cross-sectional area is $`3.0 \text{ cm}^2`$? (This is approximately the cross-sectional area of a tibia, or shin bone, at its narrowest point.) (b) Estimate the maximum height from which a $`70 \text{ kg}`$ man could jump and not fracture his tibia. Take the time between when he first touches the floor and when he has stopped to be $`0.030 \text{ s}`$, and assume that the stress on his two legs is distributed equally.
