BIO **Downward-Facing Dog.** The yoga exercise “Downward-
Facing Dog” requires stretching your hands straight out above your head
and bending down to lean against the floor. This exercise is performed by
a 750 N person as shown in Fig. P11.67. When he bends his body at the
hip to a 90° angle between his legs and trunk, his legs, trunk, head, and
arms have the dimensions indicated. Furthermore, his legs and feet weigh
a total of 277 N, and their center of mass is 41 cm from his hip, measured
along his legs. The person’s trunk, head, and arms weigh 473 N, and their
center of gravity is 65 cm from his hip, measured along the upper body.
(a) Find the normal force that the floor exerts on each foot and on each
hand, assuming that the person does not favor either hand or either foot.
(b) Find the friction force on each foot and on each hand, assuming that it
is the same on both feet and on both hands (but not necessarily the same
on the feet as on the hands). [*Hint*: First treat his entire body as a system;
then isolate his legs (or his upper body).]
