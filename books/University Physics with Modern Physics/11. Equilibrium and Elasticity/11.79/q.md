An engineer is designing a conveyor system for loading hay bales into a wagon **(Fig. P11.79)**. Each bale is 0.25 m wide, 0.50 m
high, and 0.80 m long (the dimension perpendicular to the plane of
the figure), with mass 30.0 kg. The center of gravity of each bale is at
its geometrical center. The coefficient of static friction between a
bale and the conveyor belt is 0.60, and the belt moves with constant
speed. (a) The angle $`\beta`$ of the conveyor is slowly increased. At some
critical angle a bale will tip (if it doesn’t slip first), and at some different critical angle it will slip (if it doesn’t tip first). Find the two
critical angles and determine which happens at the smaller angle. (b)
Would the outcome of part (a) be different if the coefficient of friction
were 0.40?
