The left-hand end of a light rod of length $`L`$ is attached to a vertical wall by a frictionless hinge. An object of mass $`m`$ is suspended from the rod at a point a distance $`\alpha L`$ from the hinge, where $`0 < \alpha \leq 1.00`$. The rod is held in a horizontal position by a light wire that runs from the right-hand end of the rod to the wall. The wire makes an angle $`\theta`$ with the rod. (a) What is the angle $`\beta`$ that the net force exerted by the hinge on the rod makes with the horizontal? (b) What is the value of $`\alpha`$ for which $`\beta = \theta`$? (c) What is $`\beta`$ when $`\alpha = 1.00`$?
