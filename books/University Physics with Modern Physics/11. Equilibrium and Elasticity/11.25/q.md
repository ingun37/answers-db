A uniform rod has one end attached to a vertical wall by a
frictionless hinge. A horizontal wire runs from the other end of the rod
to a point on the wall above the hinge and holds the rod at an angle $`\theta`$ above the horizontal. You vary the angle $`\theta`$ by changing the length of
the wire, and for each $`\theta`$ you measure the tension *T* in the wire. You plot
your data in the form of a *T*-versus-$`\cot \theta`$ graph. The data lie close to a
straight line that has slope 30.0 N. What is the mass of the rod?
