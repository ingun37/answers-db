The left-hand end of a uniform rod of mass 2.00 kg and
length 1.20 m is attached to a vertical wall by a frictionless hinge.
The rod is held in a horizontal position by an aluminum wire that runs
between the right-hand end of the rod and a point on the wall that is
above the hinge. The cross-sectional radius of the wire is 2.50 mm,
and the wire makes an angle of 30.0Â° with the rod. (a) What is the
length of the wire? (b) An object of mass 90.0 kg is suspended from
the right-hand end of the rod. What is the increase in the length of the
wire when this object is added? In your analysis do you need to be
concerned that the lengthening of the wire means that the rod is no
longer horizontal?
