A uniform, 7.5-m-long beam weighing 6490 N is hinged to
a wall and supported by a thin cable attached 1.5 m from the free end of
the beam. The cable runs between the beam and the wall and makes a
40° angle with the beam. What is the tension in the cable when the beam
is at an angle of 30° above the horizontal?
