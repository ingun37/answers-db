An angler hangs a $`4.50 \text{ kg}`$ fish from a vertical steel wire $`1.50 \text{ m}`$ long and $`5.00 \times 10^{-3} \text{ cm}^2`$ in cross-sectional area. The upper end of the wire is securely fastened to a support. (a) Calculate the amount the wire is stretched by the hanging fish. The angler now applies a varying force $`\vec{F}`$ at the lower end of the wire, pulling it very slowly downward by $`0.500 \text{ mm}`$ from its equilibrium position. For this downward motion, calculate (b) the work done by gravity; (c) the work done by the force $`\vec{F}`$; (d) the work done by the force the wire exerts on the fish; and (e) the change in the elastic potential energy (the potential energy associated with the tensile stress in the wire). Compare the answers in parts (d) and (e).
