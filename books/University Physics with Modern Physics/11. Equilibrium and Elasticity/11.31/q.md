A lead sphere has volume $`6.0 \text{cm}^3`$ when it is resting on a lab
table, where the pressure applied to the sphere is atmospheric pressure.
The sphere is then placed in the fluid of a hydraulic press. What increase in the pressure above atmospheric pressure produces a 0.50%
decrease in the volume of the sphere?
