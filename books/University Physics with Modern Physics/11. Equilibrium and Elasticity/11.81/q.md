A garage door is mounted on an overhead rail (Fig. P11.81). The wheels at A and B have rusted so that they do not roll, but rather
slide along the track. The coefficient
of kinetic friction is 0.52. The distance between the wheels is 2.00 m,
and each is 0.50 m from the vertical
sides of the door. The door is uniform and weighs 950 N. It is pushed
to the left at constant speed by a horizontal force $`\vec{F}`$
, that is applied as shown in the figure. (a) If the distance
h is 1.60 m, what is the vertical component of the force exerted on each
wheel by the track? (b) Find the maximum value h can have without
causing one wheel to leave the track.
