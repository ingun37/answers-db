A uniform rod of length L rests on a frictionless horizontal
surface. The rod pivots about a fixed frictionless axis at one end. The
rod is initially at rest. A bullet traveling parallel to the horizontal surface
and perpendicular to the rod with speed v strikes the rod at its center
and becomes embedded in it. The mass of the bullet is one-fourth the
mass of the rod. (a) What is the final angular speed of the rod? (b) What
is the ratio of the kinetic energy of the system after the collision to the
kinetic energy of the bullet before the collision?
