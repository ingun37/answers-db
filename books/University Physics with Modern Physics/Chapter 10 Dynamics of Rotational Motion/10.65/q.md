A solid uniform sphere and a thin-walled, hollow sphere
have the same mass M and radius R. If they roll without slipping up
a ramp that is inclined at an angle $`\beta`$ above the horizontal and if both
have the same $`v_\text{cm}`$ before they start up the incline, calculate the maxi-
mum height above their starting point reached by each object. Which
object reaches the greater height, or do both of them reach the same
height?
