A size-5 soccer ball of diameter 22.6 cm and mass 426 g rolls up a hill without slipping, reaching a maximum height of 5.00 m above the base of the hill. We can model this ball as a thin-walled hollow sphere. (a) At what rate was it rotating at the base of the hill? (b) How much rotational kinetic energy did it have then? Neglect rolling friction and assume the systemâ€™s total mechanical energy is conserved.
