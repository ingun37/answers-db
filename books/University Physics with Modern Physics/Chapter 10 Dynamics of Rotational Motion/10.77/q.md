A 42.0-cm-diameter wheel, consisting of a rim and six
spokes, is constructed from a thin, rigid plastic material having a linear
mass density of 25.0 g/cm. This wheel is released from rest at the top of
a hill 58.0 m high. (a) How fast is it rolling when it reaches the bottom
of the hill? (b) How would your answer change if the linear mass den-
sity and the diameter of the wheel were each doubled?
