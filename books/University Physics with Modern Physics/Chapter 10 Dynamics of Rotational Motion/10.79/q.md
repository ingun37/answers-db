A uniform solid cylinder with mass M and radius 2R rests on
a horizontal tabletop. A string is attached by a yoke to a frictionless axle
through the center of the cylinder so that the cylinder can rotate about
the axle. The string runs over a disk-shaped pulley with mass M and ra-
dius R that is mounted on a frictionless axle through its center. A block
of mass M is suspended from the free end of the string (Fig. P10.79).
The string doesnâ€™t slip over the pulley surface, and the cylinder rolls
without slipping on the tabletop. Find the magnitude of the acceleration
of the block after the system is released from rest.
