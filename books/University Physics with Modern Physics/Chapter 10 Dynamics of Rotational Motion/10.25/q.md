A 392 N wheel comes off a moving truck and rolls without slipping along a highway. At the bottom of a hill it is rotating at 25.0 rad/s. The radius of the wheel is 0.600 m, and its moment of inertia about its rotation axis is 0.800 $`MR^2`$. Friction does work on the wheel as it rolls up the hill to a stop, a height $`h`$ above the bottom of the hill; this work has absolute value 2600 J. Calculate $`h`$.
