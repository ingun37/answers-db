**The Spinning Figure Skater.** The outstretched hands
and arms of a figure skater preparing for a spin can be considered a
slender rod pivoting about an axis
through its center (Fig. E10.45).
When the skaterâ€™s hands and arms
are brought in and wrapped around
his body to execute the spin, the
hands and arms can be considered
a thin-walled, hollow cylinder. His
hands and arms have a combined
mass of 8.0 kg. When outstretched, they span 1.8 m; when wrapped,
they form a cylinder of radius 25 cm. The moment of inertia about
the rotation axis of the remainder of his body is constant and equal to 0.40 $`\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2`$
. If his original angular speed is 0.40 rev/s, what is his final
angular speed?
