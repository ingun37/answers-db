A 2.20 kg hoop 1.20 m in diameter is rolling to the right without slipping on a horizontal floor at a steady 2.60 rad>s. (a) How fast is its center moving? (b) What is the total kinetic energy of the hoop? (c) Find the velocity vector of each of the following points, as viewed by a person at rest on the ground: (i) the highest point on the hoop; (ii) the lowest point on the hoop; (iii) a point on the right side of the hoop, midway between the top and the bottom. (d) Find the velocity vector for each of the points in part (c), but this time as viewed by someone moving along with the same velocity as the hoop.
