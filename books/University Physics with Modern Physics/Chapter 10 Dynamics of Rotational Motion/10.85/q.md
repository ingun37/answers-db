A 500.0 g bird is flying horizontally at 2.25 m/s, not paying much attention, when it suddenly flies into a stationary vertical bar, hitting it 25.0 cm below the top
(Fig. P10.85). The bar is uniform,
0.750 m long, has a mass of 1.50 kg,
and is hinged at its base. The collision stuns the bird so that it just
drops to the ground afterward (but soon recovers to fly happily away).
What is the angular velocity of the bar (a) just after it is hit by the bird
and (b) just as it reaches the ground?
