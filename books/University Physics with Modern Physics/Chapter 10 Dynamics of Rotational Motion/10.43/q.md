Under some circumstances, a star can collapse into an ex-
tremely dense object made mostly of neutrons and called a *neutron star*.
The density of a neutron star is roughly $`10^{14}`$ times as great as that of
ordinary solid matter. Suppose we represent the star as a uniform, solid,
rigid sphere, both before and after the collapse. The starâ€™s initial radius
was $`7.0 \times 10^5`$ km (comparable to our sun); its final radius is 16 km. If
the original star rotated once in 30 days, find the angular speed of the
neutron star.
