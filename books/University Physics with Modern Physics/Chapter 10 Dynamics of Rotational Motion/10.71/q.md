**The Yo-yo.** A yo-yo is made from two uniform disks, each
with mass m and radius R, connected by a light axle of radius b. A light,
thin string is wound several times around the axle and then held sta-
tionary while the yo-yo is released from rest, dropping as the string
unwinds. Find the linear acceleration and angular acceleration of the
yo-yo and the tension in the string.
