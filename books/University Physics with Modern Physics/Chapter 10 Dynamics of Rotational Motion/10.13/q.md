A 2.00 kg textbook rests on a frictionless, horizontal surface. A cord attached to the book passes over a pulley whose diameter
is 0.150 m, to a hanging book with mass 3.00 kg. The system is released from rest, and the books are observed to move 1.20 m in 0.800 s.
(a) What is the tension in each part of the cord? (b) What is the moment
of inertia of the pulley about its rotation axis?
