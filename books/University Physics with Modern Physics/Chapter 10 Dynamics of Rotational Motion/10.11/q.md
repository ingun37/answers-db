A machine part has the shape of a solid uniform sphere of
mass 225 g and diameter 3.00 cm. It is spinning about a frictionless axle
through its center, but at one point on its equator it is scraping against
metal, resulting in a friction force of 0.0200 N at that point. (a) Find its
angular acceleration. (b) How long will it take to decrease its rotational
speed by 22.5 rad/s ?
