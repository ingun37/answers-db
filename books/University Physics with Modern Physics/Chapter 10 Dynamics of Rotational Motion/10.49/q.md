A small 10.0 g bug stands at one end of a thin uniform bar
that is initially at rest on a smooth horizontal table. The other end of
the bar pivots about a nail driven into the table and can rotate freely,
without friction. The bar has mass 50.0 g and is 100 cm in length. The
bug jumps off in the horizontal direction, perpendicular to the bar, with
a speed of 20.0 cm>s relative to the table. (a) What is the angular speed
of the bar just after the frisky insect leaps? (b) What is the total kinetic
energy of the system just after the bug leaps? (c) Where does this en-
ergy come from?
