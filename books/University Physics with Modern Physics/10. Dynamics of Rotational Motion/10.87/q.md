A 55 kg runner runs around the edge of a horizontal turn-
table mounted on a vertical, frictionless axis through its center. The
runnerâ€™s velocity relative to the earth has magnitude 2.8 m/s. The
turntable is rotating in the opposite direction with an angular velocity
of magnitude 0.20 rad>s relative to the earth. The radius of the turntable is 3.0 m, and its moment of inertia about the axis of rotation is $`80 \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2`$. Find the final angular velocity of the system if the runner
comes to rest relative to the turntable. (You can model the runner as
a particle.)
