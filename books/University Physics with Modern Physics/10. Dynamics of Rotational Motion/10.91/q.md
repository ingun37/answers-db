A block with mass m is revolving with linear
speed v1 in a circle of radius r1 on a frictionless horizontal surface
(see Fig. E10.42). The string is slowly pulled from below until the
radius of the circle in which the block is revolving is reduced to $`r_2`$. (a) Calculate the tension T in the string as a function of r, the distance
of the block from the hole. Your answer will be in terms of the initial
velocity $`v_1`$ and the radius $`r_1`$. (b) Use $`W = \int_{r_1}^{r_2} \vec{T} (r) \cdot d \vec{r}`$ to calculate the
work done by $`\vec{T}`$ when $`r`$ changes from $`r_1`$ to $`r_2`$. (c) Compare the results of
part (b) to the change in the kinetic energy of the block.
