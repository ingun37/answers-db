**Stabilization of the Hubble Space Telescope.** The Hubble
Space Telescope is stabilized to within an angle of about 2-millionths
of a degree by means of a series of gyroscopes that spin at 19,200 rpm.
Although the structure of these gyroscopes is actually quite complex,
we can model each of the gyroscopes as a thin-walled cylinder of mass
2.0 kg and diameter 5.0 cm, spinning about its central axis. How large
a torque would it take to cause these gyroscopes to precess through an
angle of $`1.0 \times 10^{-6}`$ degree during a 5.0 hour exposure of a galaxy?
