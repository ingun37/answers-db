A wheel rotates without friction about a stationary horizontal axis at the center of the wheel. A constant tangential force equal to
80.0 N is applied to the rim of the wheel. The wheel has radius 0.120 m.
Starting from rest, the wheel has an angular speed of 12.0 rev/s after
2.00 s. What is the moment of inertia of the wheel?
