A demonstration gyroscope wheel is constructed by remov-
ing the tire from a bicycle wheel 0.650 m in diameter, wrapping lead
wire around the rim, and taping it in place. The shaft projects 0.200 m
at each side of the wheel, and a woman holds the ends of the shaft in
her hands. The mass of the system is 8.00 kg; its entire mass may be as-
sumed to be located at its rim. The shaft is horizontal, and the wheel is
spinning about the shaft at 5.00 rev/s. Find the magnitude and direction
of the force each hand exerts on the shaft (a) when the shaft is at rest;
(b) when the shaft is rotating in a horizontal plane about its center at
0.050 rev/s; (c) when the shaft is rotating in a horizontal plane about its
center at 0.300 rev/s. (d) At what rate must the shaft rotate in order that
it may be supported at one end only?
