A playground merry-go-round has radius 2.40 m and moment of inertia 2100 $`\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2`$ about a vertical axle through its center, and it turns with negligible friction. (a) A child applies an 18.0 N force tangentially to the edge of the merry-go-round for 15.0 s. If the merrygo-round is initially at rest, what is its angular speed after this 15.0 s interval? (b) How much work did the child do on the merry-go-round? (c) What is the average power supplied by the child?
