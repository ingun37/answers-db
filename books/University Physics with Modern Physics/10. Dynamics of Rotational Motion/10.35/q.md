A 2.80 kg grinding wheel is in the form of a solid cylinder of radius 0.100 m. (a) What constant torque will bring it from rest to an angular speed of 1200 rev/min in 2.5 s? (b) Through what angle has it turned during that time? (c) Use Eq. (10.21) to calculate the work done by the torque. (d) What is the grinding wheelâ€™s kinetic energy when it is rotating at 1200 rev/min ? Compare your answer to the result in part (c).
