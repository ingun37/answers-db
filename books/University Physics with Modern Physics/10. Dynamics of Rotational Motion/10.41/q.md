A hollow, thin-walled sphere of mass 12.0 kg and di-
ameter 48.0 cm is rotating about an axle through its center. The angle
(in radians) through which it turns as a function of time (in seconds) is given by $`\theta(t) = A t^2 + Bt^4`$, where A has numerical value 1.50 and B has numerical value 1.10. (a) What are the units of the constants A and
B? (b) At the time 3.00 s, find (i) the angular momentum of the sphere
and (ii) the net torque on the sphere.
