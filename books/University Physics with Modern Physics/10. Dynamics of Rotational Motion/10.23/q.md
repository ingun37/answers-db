A solid ball is released from rest and slides down a hillside that slopes downward at 65.0Â° from the horizontal. (a) What minimum value must the coefficient of static friction between the hill and ball surfaces have for no slipping to occur? (b) Would the coefficient of friction calculated in part (a) be sufficient to prevent a hollow ball (such as a soccer ball) from slipping? Justify your answer. (c) In part (a), why did we use the coefficient of static friction and not the coefficient of kinetic friction?
