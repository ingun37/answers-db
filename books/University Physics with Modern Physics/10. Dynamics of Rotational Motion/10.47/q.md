A large wooden turntable in the shape of a flat uniform
disk has a radius of 2.00 m and a total mass of 120 kg. The turntable
is initially rotating at 3.00 rad/s about a vertical axis through its center.
Suddenly, a 70.0 kg parachutist makes a soft landing on the turntable at
a point near the outer edge. (a) Find the angular speed of the turntable
after the parachutist lands. (Assume that you can treat the parachutist
as a particle.) (b) Compute the kinetic energy of the system before and
after the parachutist lands. Why are these kinetic energies not equal?
