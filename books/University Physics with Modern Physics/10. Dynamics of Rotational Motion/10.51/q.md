You live on a planet far from ours. Based on extensive com-
munication with a physicist on earth, you have determined that all laws
of physics on your planet are the same as ours and you have adopted the
same units of seconds and meters as on earth. But you suspect that the
value of $`g`$, the acceleration of an object in free fall near the surface of
your planet, is different from what it is on earth. To test this, you take a
solid uniform cylinder and let it roll down an incline. The vertical height $`h`$
of the top of the incline above the lower end of the incline can be
varied. You measure the speed $`v_\text{cm}`$ of the center of mass of the cylinder
when it reaches the bottom for various values of $`h`$. You plot $`{v_\text{cm}}^2`$ (in $`\text{m}/\text{s}^2`$) versus $`h`$ (in m) and find that your data lie close to a straight line
with a slope of 6.42 $`\text{m}/\text{s}^2`$. What is the value of $`g`$ on your planet?
