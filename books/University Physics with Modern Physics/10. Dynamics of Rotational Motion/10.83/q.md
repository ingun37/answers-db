In your job as a mechanical engineer you are designing a
flywheel and clutch-plate system like the one in Example 10.11. Disk
A is made of a lighter material than disk B, and the moment of inertia of
disk A about the shaft is one-third that of disk B. The moment of
inertia of the shaft is negligible. With the clutch disconnected, A is
brought up to an angular speed $`\omega_0`$; B is initially at rest. The accelerating torque is then removed from A, and A is coupled to B. (Ignore
bearing friction.) The design specifications allow for a maximum of
2400 J of thermal energy to be developed when the connection is
made. What can be the maximum value of the original kinetic energy
of disk A so as not to Â­ exceed the maximum allowed value of the thermal energy?
