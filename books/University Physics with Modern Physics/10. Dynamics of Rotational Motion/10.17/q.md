A solid cylinder with radius 0.140 m is mounted on a
frictionless, stationary axle that lies along the cylinder axis. The cylin-
der is initially at rest. Then starting at $`t=0`$ a constant horizontal force
of 3.00 N is applied tangential to the surface of the cylinder. You mea-
sure the angular displacement $`\theta - \theta_0`$ of the cylinder as a function of
the time t since the force was first applied. When you plot $`\theta - \theta_0`$ (in
radians) as a function of $`t^2`$ (in $`s^2`$), your data lie close to a straight line. If
the slope of this line is 16.0 rad/$`s^2`$, what is the moment of inertia of the
cylinder for rotation about the axle?
