(1.7) is

```math
0 \xrightarrow {\varphi_0} V_1 \xrightarrow {\varphi_1} V_2 \xrightarrow {\varphi_2} V_3 \xrightarrow {\varphi_3} 0
```

which is a **short exact sequence**.

The image of $`{\varphi_0}`$ is $`\{0\}`$.  
Therefore the kernel of $`\varphi_1`$ is also $`\{0\}`$  
Therefore $`\varphi_1`$ is injective.

The kernel of $`{\varphi_3}`$ is $`V_3`$ itself.  
Therefore the image of $`{\varphi_2}`$ is $`V_3`$ itself.  
Therefore $`{\varphi_2}`$ is surjective.
