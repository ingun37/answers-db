Consider a monoid homomorphism from lists of integers with concatenation to integers with multiplication. What is the image of the empty list `[]`? Assume that all singleton lists are mapped to the integers they contain, that is `[3]` is mapped to 3, etc. What's the image of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`? How many different lists map to the integer 12? Is there any other homomorphism between the two monoids?
