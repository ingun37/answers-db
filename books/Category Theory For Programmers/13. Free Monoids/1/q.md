You might think (as I did, originally) that the requirement that a homomorphism of monoids preserve the unit is redundant. After all, we know that for all `a`
`h a * h e = h (a * e) = h a`
So `h e` acts like a right unit (and, by analogy, as a left unit). The problem is that `h a`, for all `a` might only cover a sub-monoid of the target monoid. There may be a “true” unit outside of the image of `h`. Show that an isomorphism between monoids that preserves multiplication must automatically preserve unit.
