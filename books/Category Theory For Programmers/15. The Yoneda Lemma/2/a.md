Let $`\eta`$ be a natural transformation from $`hom(X, -)`$ to $`F X`$. $`\eta_X`$ is a function of $`\eta_X : hom(X,X) \rightarrow F X`$. Since $`hom(X,X)`$ is a singleton set, there are different $`\eta_X`$ as many as the cardinality of $`F X`$. In the mean time there is only one kind of $`\eta_A`$, the *absurd* function , for any other component than $`X`$ because $`hom(X, A)`$ is empty. Therefore there are different $`\eta`$ as many as $`F A`$.
