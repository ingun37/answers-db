For convinience, since free monoid from singleton generator is isomorphic to natural numbers, I'll denote 0 as identity element and 1 as singleton element.

Let's define $g$ with $f$.  
$g(1) = f(1)$  
$g$ is homomorphism so by definition below statements will automatically be hold.  
$g(0) = e$ where $e$ is $m$'s identity.  
$g(1 + 1) = f(1) \cdot f(1)$ where $\cdot$ is $m$'s operator.  

Now Let's define $f$ with $g$.  
Since $f$'s domain has only one element below would be sufficient.  
$f(1) = g(1)$  

Hence $g$ and $f$ is one-to-one correspondent.
