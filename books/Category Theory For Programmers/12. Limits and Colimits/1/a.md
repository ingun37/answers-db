Let $`I`$ be the image category of the pushout consisting of $`z \rightarrow x`$ and $`z \rightarrow y`$

Let $`a`$ be the colimit of $`I`$. For any $`b`$ that is a super class of both $`x'`$ and $`y'`$, $`a`$ is deriving $`b`$.
Its the opposite definition of the pullback described in 12.2-Examples of Limits
