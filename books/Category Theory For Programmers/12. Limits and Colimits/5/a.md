Let $P$ be the image category of pullback
Let $F_2$ be the functor that maps elements of $2$ to $a$, $b$ in $C$ each.
Let $F_p$ be the functor that maps elements of $P$ to $a$, $b$, $t$ in $C$ where $t$ is the terminal object.

Diagram would be looking like this.

You can make a functor that maps each element of $2$ into $P a, b$ respectively. This functor means that every apex of $P$ is also an apex of $2$ hence theres unique morphism $LimF_p \rightarrow LimF_2$ .

Since $t$ is terminal there is a exactly one morphism going from $LimF_2$ to $t$

that makes a natural transformation hence $LimF_2$ is also an apex of pullback. That means theres a unique morphism $LimF_2 \rightarrow LimF_p$

isomorphism BAM!
