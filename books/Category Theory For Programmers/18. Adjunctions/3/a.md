So far we have derived unit and counit from hom-sets isomorphism and injectivity $C(Ld,c) \rightarrow D(d,Rc)$ from unit and counit. The only thing left to proove the equivalence is injectivity in the other way.  
In the book we derived injection $C(Ld,c) \rightarrow D(d,Rc)$ by lifting $f:Ld \rightarrow c$ with $R$. In the same way we can derive the other way injection $D(d,Rc) \rightarrow C(Ld,c)$ by lifting $g:d \rightarrow Rc$ with $L$.  
Lifted $Lg$ can be composed with unit $\eta$ and make a morphism $Lg \cdot \eta: Ld \rightarrow c$.
