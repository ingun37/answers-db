Coproduct functor as Left adjoint and square functor as right adjoint, we can build an adjunction like this.

By definition of coproduct, $`m`$ and pair of $`<p,q>`$ must be isomorphic.  
We can define factorizer by composing counit $`\varepsilon`$ and $`L<p,q>`$ and the inverse by composing $`Rm`$ and unit $`\eta`$.
