The book already derived unit $`\eta`$ by replacing $`c`$ with $`Ld`$. In the same way we can derive $`\varepsilon`$ by replacing $`d`$ with $`Rc`$.  
Replacing $`d`$ with $`Rc`$ gives us  
$`C(LRc,c) \cong D(Rc,Rc)`$  
There's at least one morphism ($`id`$) in $`D(Rc, Rc)`$ so there must be a corresponding morphism in $`C(LRc,c)`$ which is the counit.
