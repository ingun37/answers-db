If a subset $`U \subset \mathbb{R} `$

* contains 1 but 2 then $`f^{-1}U = [0,1]`$, which is open
* contains 2 but 1 then $`f^{-1}U = [2,4]`$, which is open
* contains both then $`f^{-1}U = [0,1] \cup [2,4]`$, which is open
* contains neither then $`f^{-1}U = \empty`$, which is open

They cover all the cases. Therefore $`f`$ is continuous.
