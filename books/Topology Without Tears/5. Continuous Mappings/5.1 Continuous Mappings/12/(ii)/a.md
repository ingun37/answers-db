Recall proposition 5.1.9

> Let $`(X,\tau)`$ and $`(Y,\tau_1)`$ be topological spaces. Then $`f:(X,\tau) \rightarrow (Y,\tau_1)`$ is continuous if and only if for every closed subset $`S`$ of $`Y`$, $`f^{-1}(S)`$ is a closed subset of $`X`$.

$`(Y,\tau_1)`$ is T1-space, therefore by definition every singleton set $`\{y\} \subset Y`$ is closed.

$`f`$ is injective, therefore every inverse image of a singleton set $`X = f^{-1}\{y\}`$ is a singleton set, e.i $`X = \{x\}`$.

$`\{y\}`$ is closed and $`f`$ is continuous therefore $`\{x\}`$ is also closed. Therefore $`(X,\tau)`$ is T1-space.
