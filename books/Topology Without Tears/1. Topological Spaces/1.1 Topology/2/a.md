(a) $\tau_{1} = \{ X, \emptyset, \{c\}, \{b,d,e\}, \{b,c,d,e\}, \{b\} \};$

> $\tau_{1}$ is not the answer. $\{c\} \cup \{b\} = \{c,b\}$ doesn't exist.

(b) $\tau_{2} = \{ X, \emptyset, \{a\}, \{b,d,e\}, \{a,b,d\}, \{a,b,d,e\} \};$

> $\tau_{2}$ is not the answer. $\{b,d,e\} \cap \{a,b,d\} = \{b,d\}$ doesn't exist.

(c) $\tau_{3} = \{ X, \emptyset, \{b\}, \{a,b,c\}, \{d,c,f\}, \{b,d,e,f\} \};$

> $\tau_{3}$ is the answer.
