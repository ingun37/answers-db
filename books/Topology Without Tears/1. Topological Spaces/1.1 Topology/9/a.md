(i) $\tau_1$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$, and every interval $(a,b)$, for $a$ and $b$ any real numbers with $a < b$ ;

> Not a topology. $(1,2) \cup (4, 5)$ should be open but it's not.

(ii) $\tau_2$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$, and every interval $(-r,r)$, for $r$ any positive real number;

> Topology. Trivial

(iii) $\tau_3$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$, and every interval $(-r,r)$, for $r$ any positive rational
number;

> Not a topology. Let $i$ be an irrational number. Union of all rational numbers $r$ that is $r\lt i$ becomes $(-i, i)$. $(-i, i)$ is not open by definition but is open since it's union of open sets.

(iv) $\tau_4$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$ and every interval $[-r,r]$, for $r$ any positive rational number;

> Not a topology for the same reason as (iii).

(v) $\tau_5$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$ and every interval $(-r,r)$, for $r$ any positive irrational number;

> Not a topology for the same reason as (iii).

(vi) $\tau_6$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$ and every interval $[-r,r]$, for $r$ any positive irrational number;

> Not a topology for the same reason as (iii).

(vii) $\tau_7$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$ and every interval $[-r,r)$, for $r$ any positive real number;

> Not a topology for the same reason as (iii). 

(viii) $\tau_8$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$ and every interval $(-r,r]$, for $r$ any positive real number;

> Not a topology for the same reason as (iii). 

(ix) $\tau_9$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$, every interval $[-r, r]$, and every interval $(-r, r)$, for $r$ any positive real number;

> Topology. Trivial

(x) $\tau_10$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\phi$, every interval $[-n,n]$, and every interval $(-r,r)$, for $n$ any positive integer and $r$ any positive real number.

> Topology. Trivial
