(i) a discrete space;

> Yes. Every subset is closed in discrete space.

(ii) an indiscrete space with at least two points;

> No. Only $`\emptyset`$ and $`X`$ is closed in indiscrete space.

(iii) an infinite set with the finite-closed topology.

> Yes. Every finite subsets are closed in finite-closed topology.

(iv) Example 1.1.2;

> No. It has no $`\{b\}`$ as open set. (or any other element except $`a`$)

(v) Example 1.1 #5 (i)

> No. Every closed sets are infinite. 

(vi) Example 1.1 #5 (ii)

> No. For the same reason as (v)

(vii) Example 1.1 #5 (iii)

> No. For the same reason as (v)

(viii) Example 1.1 #6 (i)

> No. Every closed sets are infinite.

(ix) Example 1.1 #6 (ii)

> No. Every closed sets must contain 1.
