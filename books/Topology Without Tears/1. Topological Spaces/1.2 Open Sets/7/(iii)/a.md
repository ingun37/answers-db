Number of powerset of $\aleph$ is $2^{\aleph}$. For any set $x$ from the powerset can make a unique topology namely $\{\emptyset, x, X\}$. Hence there are at least $2^{\aleph}$ topologies. $2^{\aleph}$. Powerset of infinite set is uncountable.(Proven in Appendix). Hence every infinite set has an uncountable number of distinct topologies on it.
