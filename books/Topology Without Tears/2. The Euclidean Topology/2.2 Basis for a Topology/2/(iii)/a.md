(ii) satisfies second property so we only need to proove that union of $`D`$ is $`\mathbb{R}^2`$

If we deny the statement and say there is a $`\langle a,b \rangle \in \mathbb{R}^2`$ that isn't contained in union of all $`D`$ then it contradicts the exercise-1-(iv) hence union of $`D`$ is $`\mathbb{R}^2`$.
