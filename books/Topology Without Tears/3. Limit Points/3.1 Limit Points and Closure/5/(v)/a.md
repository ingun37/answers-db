$`\mathbb{Q}`$ is countable dense subset right?  
$`\mathbb{I}`$ is uncountable and distinct from $`\mathbb{Q}`$ so for each $`i \in \mathbb{I}`$ we an make uncountable number of $`\mathbb{Q} + i`$ which is countable dense subset.  

Cardinality of $`\mathbb{I}`$ is $`\mathfrak{c}`$ which is same as $`\mathbb{R}`$.  
Cardinality of $`\mathbb{I}^{+}`$ is also $`\mathfrak{c}`$  
So $`\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{I}^+)`$ has cardinality of $`2^\mathfrak{c}`$.  
For all $`s \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{I}^+)`$, we can define $`\mathbb{R}^- \cap s`$ which is distinct, uncountable
