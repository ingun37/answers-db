For (i), (ii), (iii) covered $`(0,1), [0,1], [0,1)`$ which are homeomorphic to every intervals in the form of $`[a,b], (a,b), [a,b), (a,b], (-\infin,a), (-\infin,a], (a,\infin), [a,\infin), (-\infin,\infin)`$. By Remarks 4.3.4, we only got $`{a}`$ left to proove. $`X`$ can't have bijective relation with singleton set.
