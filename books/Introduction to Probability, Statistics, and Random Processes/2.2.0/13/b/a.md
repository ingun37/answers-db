Let $`X`$ be the random variable of number of heads, $`B`$ the event of choosing the second coin. We are asked for this

```math
P(B|X>2)
```

Using Bayes' rule

```math
= \cfrac{P(X>2|B)P(B)}{P(X>2)}
```

We've already got the denominator $`P(X>2)`$ from (a). We've also got the $`P(X>2|B)`$ from the process of (a). Combine them all.

```math
\approx \cfrac{0.2098 * 0.5}{0.3549} \\
\approx 0.2955762
```
