You would like to go from point $`A`$ to point $`B`$ in Figure 1.28. There are 5 bridges on different branches of the river as shown in Figure 1.29.

Bridge $`i`$ is open with probability $`i=1,2,3,4,5`$. Let $`A`$ be the event that there is a path from $`A`$ to $`B`$ and let $`B_k`$ be the event that $`k^{th}`$ bridge is open.
