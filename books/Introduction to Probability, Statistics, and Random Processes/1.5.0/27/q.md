Consider a communication system. At any given time, the communication channel is in good condition with probability 0.8, and is in bad condition with probability 0.2. An error occurs in a transmission with probability 0.1 if the channel is in good condition, and with probability 0.3 if the channel is in bad condition. Let $`G`$ be the event that the channel is in good condition and $`E`$ be the event that there is an error in transmission.
