One way to design a spam filter is to look at the words in an email. In particular, some words are more frequent in spam emails. Suppose that we have the following information:

* 50%  of emails are spam;
* 1% of spam emails contain the word "refinance";
* 0.001% of non-spam emails contain the word "refinance".

Suppose that an email is checked and found to contain the word "refinance". What is the probability that the email is spam?
