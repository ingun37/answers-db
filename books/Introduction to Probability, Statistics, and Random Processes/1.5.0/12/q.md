Recall that

```math
= \{H,T\} \times \{H,T\} \times \{H,T\}
```

Consider the following function

```math
f: \{H,T\}^3 \longrightarrow \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\},
```

defined as

```math
f(x)=\text{the number of H's in $x$}.
```

For example,

```math
f(HTH)=2.
```

a. Determine the domain and co-domain for $`f`$.  
b. Find range of $`f`$: Range($`f`$).  
c. If we know $`f(x)=2`$ what can we say about $`x`$?
