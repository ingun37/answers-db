Suppose that, of all the customers at a coffee shop,

* 70% purchase a cup of coffee;
* 40% purchase a piece of cake;
* 20% purchase both a cup of coffee and a piece of cake.

Given that a randomly chosen customer has purchased a piece of cake, what is the probability that he/she has also purchased a cup of coffee?
