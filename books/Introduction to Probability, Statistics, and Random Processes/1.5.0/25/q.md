A professor thinks students who live on campus are more likely to get $`A`$s in the probability course. To check this theory, the professor combines the data from the past few years:

1. 600 students have taken the course,
2. 120 students have gotten $`A`$s,
3. 200 students lived on campus,
4. 80 students lived off campus and got $`A`$s.

Does this data suggest that *getting an $`A`$* and *living on campus* are dependent or independent?
