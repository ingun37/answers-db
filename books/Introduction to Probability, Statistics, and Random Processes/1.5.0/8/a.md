Let $`(a,b)`$ be any open set such that $`1 \in (a,b)`$. There is always $`A_n`$ such that $`a \in A_n`$ because for any $`a'`$ such that $`a \lt a' \lt 1`$, we can make a $`A_n = [0,a')`$ by setting $`n`$ as:

```math
n = \frac{1}{1 - a'}
```

Therefore $`1`$ is a limit point of $`A`$. Therefore $`A = [0,1)`$.
