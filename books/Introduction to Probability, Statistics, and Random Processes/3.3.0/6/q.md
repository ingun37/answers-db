$`N`$ guests arrive at a party. Each person is wearing a hat. We collect all the hats and then randomly redistribute the hats, giving each person one of the $`N`$ hats randomly. Let $`X_N`$ be the number of people who receive their own hats. Find the PMF of $`X_N`$.

Hint: We previously found that (Problem 7 in Section 2.1.5)

```math
P(X_N=0)=\frac{1}{2!}-\frac{1}{3!}+\frac{1}{4!}- \cdots (-1)^N\frac{1}{N!}
```

for $`N=1,2, \cdots`$. Using this, find $`P(X_N=k)`$ for all $`k \in \{0,1, \cdots N\}`$
