Show that (BP1) may be rewritten as

```math
\delta^L = \Sigma'(z^L) \nabla_a C
\tag{33}
```

where $`\Sigma'(z^L)`$ is a square matrix whose diagonal entries are the values $`\sigma'(z^L_j)`$, and whose off-diagonal entries are zero. Note that this matrix acts on $`\nabla_a C`$ by conventional matrix multiplication.
