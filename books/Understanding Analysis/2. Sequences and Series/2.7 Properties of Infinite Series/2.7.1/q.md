Proving the Alternating Series Test (Theorem 2.7.7) amounts to showing that the sequence of partial sums
```math
s_n = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - \cdots \pm a_n
```
converges. (The opening example in Section 2.1 includes a typical illustration of $`(s_n)`$.) Different characterizations of completeness lead to different proofs.
