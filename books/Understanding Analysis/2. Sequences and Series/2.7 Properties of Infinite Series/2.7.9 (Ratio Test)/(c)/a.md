Let $` r' `$ satisfy $` r < r' < 1 `$.

Sequence

```math
|a_0|, |r'a_0|, |r'^2 a_0|, |r'^3 a_0|, \dots
```

is (eventually) bigger than the original sequence $`(|a_n|)`$ and has convergent partial sums becasue it's a geometric series.

Therefore by Comparison Test, $`\sum |a_n|`$ converges and therefore $` \sum a_n `$ converges too.
