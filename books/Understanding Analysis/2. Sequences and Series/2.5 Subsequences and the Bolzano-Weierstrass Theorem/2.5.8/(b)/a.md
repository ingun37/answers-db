When a sequence converges, it must converge from up or down (or both). Pick one and make monotone subsequence from that.

When a sequence diverges, it's either bounded or not. If it's bounded then it must have converging subsequence and you can construct a monotone subsequence from that. If it's not bounded, then at every point there must be upcoming bigger (or smaller depending it's direction of growth) point. Keep doing it and you consturct monotone subsequence.

If a sequence is bounded then it's monotone subsequence must converge.
