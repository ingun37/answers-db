The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem is extremely important, and so is the strategy employed in the proof. To gain some more experience with this technique, assume the Nested Interval Property is true and use it to provide a proof of the Axiom of Completeness. To prevent the argument from being circular, assume also that $`(1/2^n) \rightarrow 0`$. (Why precisely is this last assumption needed to avoid circularity?)
