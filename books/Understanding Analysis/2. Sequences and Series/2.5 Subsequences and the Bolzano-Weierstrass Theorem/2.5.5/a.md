Assume $`(a_n)`$ diverges. According to exercise 2.5.2-(c), bounded and diverging sequence must have at least two limit points. But $`(a_n)`$ is said to have only one limit point which is contradiction. Therefore $`(a_n)`$ converges.

Subsequence of converging sequence has the same limit point therefore $`(a_n)`$ converges to $`a`$.
