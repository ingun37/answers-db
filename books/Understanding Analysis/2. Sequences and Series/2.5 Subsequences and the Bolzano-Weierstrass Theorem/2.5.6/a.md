Square root preserves equality. Proof is here ðŸ‘‰ [StackExchange - Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/695290/proof-that-the-limit-of-the-square-root-is-the-square-root-of-the-limit)

$` \sqrt {b^{1/n}} = b^{1/2n}`$ and this is a subsequence therefore the limit must be the same to the original sequence.

```math
\sqrt l = l = 1
```
