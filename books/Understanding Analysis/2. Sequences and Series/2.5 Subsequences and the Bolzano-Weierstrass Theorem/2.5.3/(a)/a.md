Say there's a series $`S`$.

```math
S = a + b + c + d + \cdots
```

Let's say starting from $`c`$ is $`S'`$. That means

```math
S = a + b + S'
```

If $`S`$ converges to $`L`$ then $`S'`$ converges to $`L - a - b`$. Therefore associativity holds.

```math
(a + b) + S' = a + (b + S')
```

Any regrouping of the terms can be reduced to $` a + b + S' `$.
