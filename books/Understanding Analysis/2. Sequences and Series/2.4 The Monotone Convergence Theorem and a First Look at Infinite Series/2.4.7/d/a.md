Every $` a_n `$ is supermum of some starting point $` a_m `$, e.i, $`\sup \{ a_m, a_{m+1}, \dots, a_n, a_{n+1} \dots \}`$ such that $` m < n `$.

Every supermum $`\sup \{ a_m, a_{m+1}, \dots, a_n, a_{n+1} \dots \}`$ is decided by some value $` a_n `$ such that $` m < n `$.

These two statements leads to the answer ...
