## Upper limit exists

### Proof (by induction)

Base case: $`x_0 = \sqrt 2 < 2`$.

Induction step: Let $`x_n < 2`$ then $`x_{n+1} = \sqrt{2+x_n} < \sqrt 4 = 2`$.

Therefore 2 is an upper bound.

## It converges

Because it's got upper bound and also increasing.

## Limit

```math
\begin {aligned}
& X = \sqrt{2+X} \\
& \rightarrow X^2 = 2+X \\
& \rightarrow X = 2
\end {aligned}
```
