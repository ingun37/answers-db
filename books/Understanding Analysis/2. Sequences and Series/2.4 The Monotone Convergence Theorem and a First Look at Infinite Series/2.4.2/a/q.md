Consider the recursively defined sequence $`y_1=1`$,

```math
y_{n+1} = 3-y_n,
```

and set $`y=\lim y_n`$. Because $`(y_n)`$ and $`(y_{n+1})`$ have the same limit, taking the limit across the recursive equation gives $`y=3-y`$. Solving for $`y`$, we conclude $`\lim y_n = 3/2`$.

What is wrong with this argument?
