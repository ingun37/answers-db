It's already shown that finite subset is compact.  
So we only need to show that infinite subset is also compact.  
Let $S$ be the infinite subset of $X$ and $x_{0}$ be it's any element  
$x_{0}\in S \subseteq X$  
Let $A$ be the open cover of $S$  
$S \subseteq \cup A$  
Let $x_0$ be any element of $S$  
$x_{0}\in S$  
For every $x_{0}$ it must be belonged to an open set $A_0$ from $A$  
$\forall x_{0},\exists A_{0}s.tx_{0}\in A_{0}\in A$  
And since $A_0$ is open and $S$ is cofinite topology, $A^{c}_{0}=X/A_{0}$ must be finite.  
$S$ is also finite. which means  
$S\cap A^{c}_{0}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2}\ldots x_{n}\right\}$  
As well as $x_0$ and $A_0$, being an element of $S$, each $x_n$ must have it's own $A_n$  
So $S$ can be expressed as union of $A_0$ to $A_n$ which is of finite number $n$ hence $S$ is compact.
