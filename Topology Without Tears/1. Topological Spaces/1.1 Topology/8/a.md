By [Axiom of Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#7._Axiom_of_infinity)

There is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $X$  
Let $A$ be Image from even numbers and $B$ image from odd numbers.  
There is no common element between them which means
$A\cap B=\emptyset$
Let $a$ be any element from $A$ and $B'$ be $B\cup \left\{ a\right\}$  
Since $B'$ is still infinite subset, is a open set.  
Since $A$ is also an open set, $A \cap B' = \{a\}$ is also an open set.  
Every singleton is open hence $(X,\tau)$ is discrete.
