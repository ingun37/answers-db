(i) $\tau_{1}$ consists of $\mathbb{N}$, $\emptyset$, and every set $\\{1,2,...,n\\}$, for $n$ any positive integer.

> Let $A$ be a union of finite or infinite number of set.  
> If there is an upper bound $u$, then $A$ will be $\\{1,2,...,u\\}$  
> If there is not an upper bound, then $A$ will be $\mathbb{N}$  
> Let $B$ be intersection of any two set $\\{1,2,...,a\\}$ and $\\{1,2,...,b\\}$ and without loss of generality let's say $a$ is smaller than $b$. Then $B$ will be $\\{1,2,...,a\\}$.

(ii) $\tau_{2}$ consists of $\mathbb{N}$, $\emptyset$, and every set $\\{n, n+1, ...\\}$, for $n$ any positive integer.

> Let $A$ be a union of finite or infinite number of set.  
> Since it's natural numbers, there must be a lower bound $l$ that is $0 \leq 1$  
> $A$ will be  $\\{l, l+1, ...\\}$  
> Let $B$ be intersection of any two set $\\{a, a+1, ...\\}$ and $\\{b, b+1, ...\\}$ and without loss of generality let's say $a \leq b$. Then $B$ will be $\\{b, b+1, ...\\}$.
