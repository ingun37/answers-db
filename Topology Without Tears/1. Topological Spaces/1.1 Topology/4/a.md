Let's say that there's finite number of $n$ of open set $U$  
Let $V_1$ be $U_{1}\cap U_{2}$
$V_1 = U_{1}\cap U_{2}$
Let $V_i$ be $U_{i+1}$
$V_i = U_{i+1}$
Then we can redefine the intersections using term of $V$ with one less operand.
$U_{1}\cap U_{2}\cap U_{3}\ldots U_{n} = V_{1}\cap V_{2}\cap V_{3}\ldots V_{n-1}$
We can go on and on and number of operands will eventually get to only 2.
$W_1 \cap W_2$
By definition of topology

> the intersection of any two sets in $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$.

It is indeed a member of $\tau$.
