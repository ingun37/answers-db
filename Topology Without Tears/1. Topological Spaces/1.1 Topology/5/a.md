(i) $\tau_{1}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\emptyset$, and every interval $(-n,n)$, for $n$ any positive integer;

> $\tau_1$ is a topology.  
> Let $A$ be the union of finite or infinite number of sets. If there is an upper bound $u$ then $A$ will be $(-u, u)$. If there is not an upper bound, then $A$ will be $\mathbb{R}$.  
> Let $B$ be the intersection of any $(-a,a)$ and $(-b,b)$. And let's say $a$ is smaller than $b$ without loss of generality. Then $B$ will be $(-a,a)$.

(ii) $\tau_{2}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\emptyset$, and every interval $[-n,n]$, for $n$ any positive integer;
> $\tau_2$ is not a topology. Union of infinite sets of $[-k, k]$ such that every $k \lt n$ is $(-n, n)$

(iii) $\tau_{3}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\emptyset$, and every interval $[-n,\infty)$, for $n$ any positive integer;
> $\tau_3$ is not a topology. For the same reason of (ii), you can deduce that $(-n, \infty)$ is open.
