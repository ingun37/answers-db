(i) Prove that every $T_1$-space is a $T_0$-space.

> For every pair $(a, b)$, each has it's singleton set which satisfies $T_0$ definition.

(ii) Which of (i)-(vi) in Exercise 3 above are $T_0$-space? (Justify your answer.)

> (i) and (iii) are $T_0$ because they are proven to be $T_1$.  
> (ii) is not $T_0$ because for every pair $(a, b)$ only open set $X$ contains both $a, b$.  
> (iv) is not $T_0$ because $\\{c, d\\}$ does not satisfy the condition.  
> (v) is $T_0$ for every pair $(a, b)$, where $\|a\| < \|b\|$, open set $(-c,c)$ where $\|a\| < c < \|b\|$ contains only $a$  
> (vi) is $T_0$ for the same reason for (v)

(iii) Put a topology $\tau$ on the set $X = \\{0,1\\}$ so that $(X,\tau)$ will be a $T_0$-space but not a $T_1$-space. 

> $\tau = \\{\emptyset, X, \\{0\\} \\}$

(iv) Prove that each of the topological spaces described in Exercise 1.1 #6 is a $T_0$-space.

> For the first one, For every pair $(a, b)$, an open set $\\{1,2..n\\}$ where $a \leq n < b$ only contains $a$.  
> For the second one, For every pair $(a, b)$, an open set $\\{n, n+1, n+2 ..\\}$ where $a < n \leq b$ only contains $b$.
