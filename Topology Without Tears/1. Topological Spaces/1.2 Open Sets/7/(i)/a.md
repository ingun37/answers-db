Let $T$ be the set of topologies from $S_n$. Let $T'$ be the set of topologies from $S_{n+1}$.  
Let's define a trivial function $f: T \rightarrow T'$ as $f(\tau) = \tau \cup \{S_{n+1}\}$  
$f$ is injective. which implies $T \leq T'$.
Let $\tau'$ be indiscrete (trivial) topology of $S_{n+1}$. This one is not in the image of $f$. Hence $T \lt T'$
