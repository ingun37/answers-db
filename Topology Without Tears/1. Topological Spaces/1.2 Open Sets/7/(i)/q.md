As recorded in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space the number of distinct topologies on a set with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ points can be very large even for small n; namely when and $n = 2$, there are 4 topologies; when $n = 3$ there are 29 topologies; when $n = 4$, there are 355 topologies; when $n = 5$ there are 6942 topologies etc. Using mathematical induction prove that as $n$ increase, the number of topologies increases
